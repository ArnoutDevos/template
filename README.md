#### [ReScience C](https://rescience-c.github.io/) article template

This repository contains the Latex optional template for writing a ReScience C
article and the (mandaotry) YAML metadata file. For the article, you're free to
use any software you like as long as you enforce the latex style.

A tool is available for the latex template that produces latex definitions from
the metadata file. If you use another software, make sure that metadata and PDF
are synced.
