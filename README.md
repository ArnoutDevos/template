#### [ReScience C](https://rescience-c.github.io/) article template

This repository contains the Latex optional template for writing a ReScience C
article and the (mandaotry) YAML metadata file. For the article, you're free to
use any software you like as long as you enforce the latex style. For the fonts, you'l need:

* [Source Serif Pro (Adobe Systems)](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro) by F. Grie√ühammer. 
* [The Roboto family of fonts (Google)](https://github.com/google/roboto) by C. Robertson.
* [Source Code Pro (Adobe Systems) by](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) P. D. Hunt.

A tool is available for the latex template that produces latex definitions from
the metadata file. If you use another software, make sure that metadata and PDF
are always synced.
